Using blinking LED in a sphere as a flag.

The led is placed in a sphere for it to propagate radially in every direction.

* Can also add color as additional information to confirm.

1) Identify the ball. Circle detection algorithim perhaps.

2) Normalize the off state. Compensate for ambient lighting conditions.

3) Identify led on state reliably. Measure on time. 


2*) Calibration phase.
*) Identify the sphere. 
 Analyse the video for few seconds.
-> Average luminace of pixels inside the circle.
-> Determine off and on ambient levels. use the leser values as normal values.
-> Average three periods.
