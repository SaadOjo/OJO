Introduction:
This document is a weekly report about the activites of the OJO group regarding the course EE493.

This week we organised three meetings. The aim of each meeting was to collaborate and share ideas and opinions for the EE493 course.
In our first meeting held on Date , we discussed about the logo and the name of the company. There were many creative names from every member but the name Ojo, presented by name, took the attention of every member. The second most thing for the company was designing a logo, again we had many creative designs and after some discussion with the members we came up with a final logo. (we can post a picture)
