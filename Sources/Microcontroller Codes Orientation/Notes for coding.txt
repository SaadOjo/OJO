Notes: 

1) After seeing the last one signal, we cannot directly go to following state because the last robot does not broadcast constant IR light.
It broadcasts the last one signal which is alternating IR light but even in that case we might be able to follow the last robot when the light is ON,
 but we should not immediately go to the searching state if we lose IR. We should wait instead for a while.
